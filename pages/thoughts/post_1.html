            <p>recalling the <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/" class="underlined-link">three virtues of a great programmer</a>, notice that one virtue stands above the rest: <strong>laziness</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>the idea behind laziness as a virtue is profound. the best programmers don't waste time on tedious, repetitive tasks. Instead, they write code that automate said tasks, making both their lives and everyone else's easier.</p>
            
            <p>the era of ai introduces a paradigm shift to this heuristic. today, the best builders don't waste time on coding programs that automate repetitive tasks. instead, they prompt coding agents in natural language to generate code that automates said tasks.</p>
            
            <p>now granted, we aren't really there yet, and perhaps research may never fruition to such a future. be that as it may, even with today's advancements, it's easy to see that the skepticism towards ai tools from the tech purists is just as unwarranted as the hype pedaled by the tech bros.</p>
            
            <p>the barrier to entry has never been lower. the future belongs to those with agency.</p>
            
            <div class="post-footer">
                <p><strong>ps:</strong> we'll always still need coders, even if we can automate coding. the number of coders will reduce and each coder will be of high quality, with their primary job shifting from writing code to reviewing them.</p>
