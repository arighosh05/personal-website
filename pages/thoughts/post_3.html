            <p>one of my favorite <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html" class="underlined-link">epigrams by Alan Perlis</a>.</p>
            
            <p>it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the details while working through a problem. in a sense, diving into the more technical side of things can feel more comforting - by situating ourselves in a familiar terrain, we feel more confident in our advance towards a potential solution. yet, in doing so, we may perhaps risk losing our grip on the problem in its entirety.</p>
            
            <p>obsessive optimization is missing the trees for the forest. many a man has gone to great lengths to solve a very specfic sub-problem within a problem, only to later lament that had they paid attention, they wouldn‚Äôt have missed the bigger picture.</p>
            
            <p>yes, everyone‚Äôs a genius in hindsight. but it‚Äôs dangerous to completely ignore the point here:</p>
            
            <p>that as important it is to build a solution piece-meal, questioning the problem itself - by reviewing how it affects the world in a top-down manner, or by examining it against first-principles in a bottom-up manner - can lead to insights that can completely shift your interpretation of the problem, and in turn, evolve you‚Äôre solution to one that surpasses mere optimization.</p>
