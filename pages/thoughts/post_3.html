            <p>the worrisome philosophy of "move fast, align later" plagues the tech landscape today.</p>
            
            <p>the alignment problem is perhaps the most important challenge that the field currently faces. yet, it has been sidelined in favor of avenues that promise to advance us in the ai arms race we are in the midst of today. while every org seeks to build its own "country of geniuses in a data center", we may inadvertently end up obliterating our own.</p>
            
            <p>there's an increasing reliance on evals and vibes to determine model robustness, which really speaks volumes to the lack of tools we have in our disposable to really examine these monstrous systems. despite that, we keep pouring more and more resources to build bigger and better models, without furnishing our toolkit with adequate tools to help us gauge alignment.</p>
            
            <p>we find ourselves at an inflection point in history like never before, where our actions today will determine whether we have a miraculous or disastrous tomorrow. hopefully, we make the right choices.</p>
            
            <p>oh btw, here's what the llms think about alignment.</p>
            
            <div class="prompt">
                so here was the prompt:
                <br><br>
                generate green text 4chan on the topic alignment in big ai that is edgy, sarcastic, controversial and funny.

            <p>well that was fun. lowkey, had low expectations for GPT 4.5 but based response icl. Grok 3 meh - the twitter training data is lame and it shows. ofc, 3.7 Sonnet bodies and it's not even close.</p>
