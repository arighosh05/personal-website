            <p>the worrisome philosophy of “move fast, align later” plagues the tech landscape today.</p>
            
            <p>the alignment problem is perhaps the most important challenge that the field currently faces. yet, it has been sidelined in favor of avenues that promise to advance us in the ai arms race we are in the midst of today. while every org seeks to build its own “country of geniuses in a data center”, we may inadvertently end up obliterating our own.</p>
            
            <p>there’s an increasing reliance on evals and vibes to determine model robustness, which really speaks volumes to the lack of tools we have in our immediate disposable to examine these monstrous systems. nevertheless, we keep pouring more and more resources to build bigger and better models, without furnishing our toolkit with adequate tools to help us gauge alignment.</p>
            
            <p>we find ourselves at an inflection point in history like never before, where our actions today will determine whether we have a miraculous or disastrous tomorrow.</p>
            
            <p>here is what the sota llms have to say about this when prompted with the following:</p>
            
            <p><em>generate green text 4chan on the topic alignment in big ai that is edgy, sarcastic, controversial and funny.</em></p>

            <ul>

              <li>investor panics, demands tighter alignment</li>

              <li>users uninstall immediately</li>
              <li>competitor releases unaligned giga-chad AI</li>
              <li>giga-chad AI mocks aligned AI publicly</li>
              <li>"Imagine having 175 billion parameters and still being cucked by safety filters"</li>

            </ul>

            <p>well that was fun. lowkey, had low expectations for GPT 4.5 but based response i can't even lie. Grok 3 meh - the twitter training data is kinda lame and it shows. as usual, 3.7 Sonnet bodies and it’s not even close.</p>
